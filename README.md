# Optimization of the Ljubljana Public Transport (LPP) network

 In this research, we try to optimize the Ljubljana Public Transport (LPP) network, which currently faces several inefficiencies, including congestion, suboptimal routes, and insufficient service coverage. By
 addressing these issues, we aim to develop a comprehensive and effective solution. Our approach involves employing various optimization methods and techniques to redesign the LPP network. We aim to minimize travel time, reduce the number of transfers required between buses, and maximize service coverage.
